-> Compatible for Iso-SPI      
-> IOT capabilities      
-> Contactor based system    
-> 8x temperature sensing (thermistor based)     
-> 3x Contactor Control (Isolated)     
-> 2x Contactor Feedback (Isolated)     
-> 1x CAN (Isolated) and 1x RS485 (Isolated)     
-> 1x UART and 1x SLEEP      
-> 1x I2C and 1x SPI (either SPI or Iso-SPI)      
-> Arduino IDE compatible     
-> 1x Buzzer and 2x LED Indication (Programmable)
